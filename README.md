# BitSplit-FSM-String-Matching
 Calculate memory requirements for Finite State Machines (FSMs) generated on a group of strings that are split into a specified number of subgroups

To run the program simple use the command:
	python3 process_strings.py
	
This will prompt the program to begin grouping 128 strings into 16 groups.
